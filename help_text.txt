🎮 HOW TO PLAY SQUIRDLE

COMMANDS:
• /start — Start your own personal Squirdle (private game, only you can see it)
• /daily — Play today's shared Daily Squirdle (public puzzle for everyone)
• /guess — Make a guess in your current game (your results are private)
• /leaderboard — View the public top solvers; your own Pokémon and rank are shown privately
• /stats — See your detailed daily and personal stats (private)

----------------------------------------
GAME RULES:
1. You have 9 tries to guess the secret Pokémon in either mode.
2. Each guess gives you hints about:
   - Generation: Earlier / later / same generation
   - Type: Shared or none in common
   - Height: Taller / shorter / same height
   - Weight: Heavier / lighter / same weight
   - Pokédex Number: Higher / lower / same number
3. If you run out of 9 tries, the game ends and reveals the Pokémon privately.

----------------------------------------
MODES:
🟢 DAILY MODE
- Everyone plays the same Pokémon each day.
- Progress is saved automatically until midnight (EDT).
- The daily answer is revealed only to you once solved or out of tries.
- Leaderboard shows everyone's rank publicly, but your Pokémon reveal stays private.

🔵 PERSONAL MODE
- Your own private Squirdle game (separate from the daily).
- Visible only to you.
- Can be quit anytime with /quit.
- Starting /daily will end your personal game and privately show its answer.

----------------------------------------
PRIVACY & VISIBILITY:
• Commands marked (private) use ephemeral messages — only you can see them.
• The public leaderboard and daily puzzle messages stay visible to everyone.
• You can safely play in any channel without revealing your Pokémon!

----------------------------------------
TIPS:
• Use Pokémon name autocomplete when guessing.
• Use logical elimination from hints.
• A new daily Pokémon drops every midnight (EDT).

Good luck, Trainer! 🍀
